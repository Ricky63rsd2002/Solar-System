# Solar-System
The Sun, our star, and everything gravitationally connected to it, including the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,
small planets like Pluto, dozens of moons, and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids, that compose our solar system.
So I use HTML and CSS to develop a solar system project.Â
